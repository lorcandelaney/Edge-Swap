Download ipfs: https://dist.ipfs.io/#go-ipfs
Export it to a folder in programfiles
Add it to the path (system env variables)

Open up a terminal.
Run the following in this order:
1. ipfs init
2. ipfs config --json API.HTTPHeaders.Access-Control-Allow-Origin "[\"*\"]"
3. ipfs config --json Gateway.HTTPHeaders.Access-Control-Allow-Origin "[\"*\"]"
4. ipfs daemon
In a separate terminal, run: testrpc -u 0 --gasLimit 100000000

In a separate terminal, go to the root of the project and run: truffle migrate
From this terminal, obtain the tree address and use it to update the address at "contract.at" in blocktest.js.

Next, run the webapp. (Open a terminal, Go to projectRoot/Webapp/src then run "python manage.py runserver")
In your browser, go to: 127.0.0.1:8000

If running the webapp failed, try : "python manage.py runserver 8080" then in your browser go to: 127.0.0.1:8080
